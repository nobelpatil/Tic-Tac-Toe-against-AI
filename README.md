## Project Name: 
TicTacToe Against AI

## About:
It is a fun game everyone have played against human. In this game you play with the Computer which uses AI. We have implemnted MinMax Algorithm for the Computer to select its move. The algorithm checks for the best score value for the play and selects the place which has highest score. We have created the tictactoe game in two platform (One has the Keyboard entries and other has mouse clicks). We created the tictactoe.exe using C++ and found that user is not able to use mouse to play and then decided to create a good Human Machine Interface for the player to be interested in playing the game, so we created the game using JavaScript which has mouse clicks for playing the game.
 
## Members:
List each team member along with a short description of their responsibility.

1. Nobel Patil - Planned and implemented the code in C++; Learned and implemented the same code in JavaScript; Enhanced the Human Machine Interface.
2. Nishchit Pandey - Planned and implemented the code in C++; Learned and implemented the same code in JavaScript; Enhanced the Human Machine Interface.

## Instructions:
The folder as a tictactoe.exe file which we have created using C++ programming language. It also has one more tictactoe.html file which is designed and implemented using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. For getting the output for this code you have to download all the file in the same folder and use it.

1. ### How to compile:
	If want to play the game in the keyboard mode, need a C++ complier.
	If want to play the game in the mouse click mode, no compiler required.

2. ### How to execute:
	If want to play the game in the keyboard mode, execute the C++ code which creates an .exe file in the same folder and can be used for playing the game.
	If want to play the game in the mouse click mode, click and open the tictactoe.html file present in the floder.

3. ### Expected output:
	As you play the game the output for the game(i.e., Win, Loss and Tie) will be displayed as an pop-up and the game will ask if you want to play again.

4. ### Known issues:
	As the project is 100% completed as proposed in the start of the class. If you want any smalll changes, we are able to make as we have learned programming in JavaScript for execution of this AI project.
